# Hero Dice

https://hero-dice.netlify.app/

A simple dice roller designed for Tiny Epic Heroes (a minimalist narrative
role-playing games designed for younger adventurers) that coincidentally works
for other systems as well:

* Tiny Epic Heroes
* Freeform Universal
* Hero Kids
* Risus

## Goal

I often find myself with random moments with my kids (waiting for the bus or
other small pockets of time) and started creating stories with them. As
a 'Forever DM' I pulled inspiration from other systems and created a system we
could use to add some unexpected twists and narrative opportunities.

(Ruleset pending on my pseudonymed gaming site: jirico.games)

But I needed everything portable. Something I could carry in my pockets that
would allow us to continue the adventure whenever the time and inspiration
allowed.

**Immediate and Visual Resolution**: It was important to me to allow a one-click
interpretation of the roll.

**Result Sounds**: When rolling, I often can't see the kid's screen. The roll
result sounds provide audio feedback of what they rolled. Soft anti-cheat
measures and it allows me to not even have to ask how they did.

## To Do

* Allow persistent preferences in localStorage
* Fine-tune animations
* Add 'light/dark' theme detection
