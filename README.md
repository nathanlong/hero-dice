# Hero Dice ðŸŽ²

This is a simple little app for rolling dice for TTRPG'S, originally designed for my custom hack: [FIG](https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/fig/)

It's intended to be:

* Very lightweight
* Quick to navigate and use
* Provide simple audio feedback for use at the table (prevents fudging because you can hear the results of some systems)
* Customizable with several color scheme options
* Support several systems:
    * Freeform Universal / FIG
    * Risus
    * Blades in the Dark
    * Powerered by the Apocalypse systems
    * D20 systems (D&D, Worlds Without Number, and many others)

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
